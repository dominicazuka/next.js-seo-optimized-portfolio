**Portfolio**

This is a Next.js portfolio website. It is currently under development, but it is already functional and can be used to showcase your work.

**Getting started**

To get started, you will need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/dominicazuka/next.js-seo-optimized-portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will open the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

**Deployment**

Once you are happy with your portfolio, you can deploy it to production using Vercel. To do this, you will need to create a Vercel account and import the repository.

Once the repository has been imported, you can deploy the website by clicking the "Deploy" button.

**Customization**

The portfolio is highly customizable. You can change the colors, fonts, layout, and content of the website to match your style.

To customize the portfolio, you will need to edit the files in the `pages` directory. The `pages` directory contains the React components that make up the website.
